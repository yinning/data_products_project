### Welcome to San Francisco Crimes Data Explorer

This application is based on Kaggle's dataset that provides nearly 12 years of crime reports from across all of San Francisco's neighborhoods.

Dataset has been obtained from [Kaggle's website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime/download/train.csv.zip) and only 10% of the data is randomly chosen to be used in this Data Explorer. 


You can adjust date range (by year) and Crime Category using control panel located on the left side. A plot of Counts of Crime by Year will be shown on the left.
